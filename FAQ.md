**Why not study just anywhere?** It’s hard to find a place where you can really focus and do deep work. Also, you will study more effectively in community, studying with, learning from, and teaching the other scholars in the house.

**How is this different from going to school?** A school is for taking classes, a Scholar House is for studying books. There are no classes in a Scholar House, just a bunch of people studying books.

**What if I don’t understand the books?** Then you will solicit the advice of more experienced scholars.

**So there will be no lectures?** Maybe. It depends what the people in the house want to do.

**What if I have a job?** That’s fine, you can still stay at a Scholar House and study there in your free time.

**What if my job is in-person?** Then you can join a Scholar House in the city your job is in, provided enough people there want to join one.

**Won’t I then be paying double rent, my normal rent and the rent for the Scholar House?** The Scholar House rent will be very cheap. For example, if 10 people rent a house on AirBnb for $3,500, that’s just $350 a person. But if you need financial assistance in order to attend a Scholar House, that can be arranged.

**Does it have to be an AirBnb?** Not necessarily. Any house that can be rented month-to-month is fine. It can also be someone opening up their house to guests.

**Why a month?** A month is a nice solid block of time in which you can really learn something. But feel free to experiment with other lengths.
