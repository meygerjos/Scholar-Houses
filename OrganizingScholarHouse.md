**How to organize a Scholar House.**

1. Find 2-3 other people who want to make a Scholar House with you.  Determine with them the subject(s) to be studied, the location, how many people, how structured or unstructured it will be, etc.
2. Split an AirBnb reservation with them and then release an advertisement giving a description of the retreat along with an application form.
3. For each good application, charge the applicant according to the guidelines below.  If you don't get enough people, refund their money and cancel the AirBnb reservation.

**Guidelines for splitting the rent**

1. People with bigger rooms pay more. People who share rooms pay less. People who camp pay even less.
2. The group that put down money for the original AirBnb reservation pay less, because they are taking on the risk that they wonâ€™t find enough people or that people will flake.  However, this guideline does not apply if the cancellation policy is such that this group is taking on minimal risk.
3. People who have less funds available pay less.
