## How to give certifications to students that they can use for job applications, put on their resume, etc.

A certification can take the form of a signed letter stating that a student has mastered certain material.  The strength of a certification is that the signatory is putting their reputation on the line.  If they sign a certification for a student who is later found not to have mastered the material, this will damage the reputation of the signatory.  People will no longer trust their certifications, letters of recommendation, etc.

### How to certify students (level 1)

**Precondition:** You must already have done the thing you are certifying the student for.  If you are certifying that they have read a book, you must have read the book.  If you are certifying that they have mastered a book (i.e. they can reproduce all the definitions and theorems), you must have mastered the book.  Etc.

**To do it:** Have a conversation with the student to determine whether they have done the thing.  If they have, write a letter describing what they have done, and sign it.

### How to certify students (level 2)

A level 2 certification is stronger as it calls upon the prestige of trusted, existing institutions, namely universities.  In a level 2 certification, a professor co-signs the certification.  Thus an invalid certification will damage the reputation of the professor, who has a lot more to lose in that regard.  Additionally, it will damage the reputation of the institution(s) that the professor is affiliated with, and even perhaps the institution that granted the professor their degree.

**Precondition:** A professor who trusts your judgment and integrity in certifying students enough to co-sign your certifications.

**To do it:** Have the professor co-sign your certifications.
